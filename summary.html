    <h1>Comprehensive Guide to Derivatives Trading</h1>

    <h2>Chapter 1: Basics of Derivatives</h2>
    <p>A derivative is a contract whose value is derived from an underlying asset, which can include metals, energy resources, agricultural commodities, and financial assets like shares, bonds, and foreign exchange. The history of derivatives spans centuries, with early milestones including forward contracts in European trade fairs and English monasteries, futures markets in Japan, and the development of exchange-traded contracts like futures and options in the US through exchanges such as the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Global growth has been driven by increased price fluctuations, global market integration, technology reducing costs, better risk management tools, and product innovation.</p>

    <p>In India, derivatives trading began with SEBI committees developing a regulatory framework, and the Securities Contract Regulation Act (SCRA) was amended to include derivatives as 'securities'. Exchange-traded derivatives in India started in June 2000 with index futures (Nifty and Sensex), followed by index options (June 2001), stock options (July 2001), and stock futures (November 2001).</p>

    <p>Key derivative product types include forwards, which are bilateral, customized, over-the-counter (OTC) contracts with obligation to buy/sell an underlying at a pre-decided future price that help fix prices and avoid price risk but have limitations including liquidity risk and counterparty risk. Futures are standardized forward contracts traded on an organized exchange where the clearing corporation guarantees settlement and the exchange decides terms except price.</p>

    <p>Options give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an underlying at a stated price on or before a date, with the buyer paying a premium and the seller having the obligation if the buyer exercises. Swaps are agreements to exchange future cash flows, generally a series of forwards, used to manage volatile interest rate, currency, and commodity price risks.</p>

    <p>Participants in the derivatives market are broadly hedgers who reduce risk exposure, traders/speculators who profit from predicting price movements using leverage, and arbitrageurs who exploit price differences for risk-free profit. Markets are categorized as exchange-traded (standardized, organized exchanges, transparent, clearing corporation guarantees) and over-the-counter (OTC) (negotiated directly, customized, less regulated, counter-party risk decentralized). Derivatives markets help in price discovery, risk transfer from low to high risk appetite participants, and shifting speculative trades to an organized, stable environment. Trading derivatives involves risks such as counterparty risk, price risk, liquidity risk, legal/regulatory risk, and operational risk, as they are leveraged instruments requiring careful consideration, with a Risk Disclosure Document provided by brokers.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 2: Understanding the Index</h2>
    <p>An index is a statistical indicator representing a market or sector, typically a portfolio of securities whose value is usually expressed relative to a base value, making the percentage change significant. Stock indices capture the overall behaviour of the equity market and are significant as indicators of market performance, benchmarks for portfolios, and underlying assets for derivatives.</p>

    <p>Types of stock market indices include market capitalization weighted indices where stocks are weighted by their market value (shares outstanding multiplied by price), with higher market cap meaning higher weight. Free-Float Market Capitalization weights are based on the market capitalization of shares readily available for trading, which most global and major Indian indices use. Price-weighted indices weight stocks proportionally to their price, with higher price giving more influence, as seen in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nikkei 225. Equal weighted indices initially give all stocks the same weight, requiring rebalancing as prices change.</p>

    <p>Attributes of a good index include reflecting market behaviour, being computed by an independent party, and being professionally maintained. Impact cost is a measure of the transaction cost arising from lack of liquidity, representing the percentage degradation from the ideal price (average of best bid/offer) when executing large orders. It differs from the bid-ask spread, which is the cost for small trades, and impact cost is low when liquidity is high.</p>

    <p>Index management involves construction (choosing stocks, methodology), maintenance (adjusting for corporate actions), and revision (changing composition), with an Index Committee making final decisions on stock inclusion/removal. Major Indian equity indices include the S&P BSE series and the Nifty series. Applications of indices include tracking market direction, serving as the basis for Index Funds that replicate index returns by investing proportionally in constituent stocks, Index Derivatives (futures and options on indices used for hedging market risk), and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) that trade like stocks and provide a low cost way to get basket exposure.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 3: Introduction to Forwards and Futures</h2>
    <p>A forward contract is a bilateral agreement to buy/sell an underlying asset at a future date and price, customized and traded OTC, where both parties are obligated but suffer from liquidity and counterparty risk. A futures contract is a standardized forward contract traded on an organized exchange, with the clearing corporation guaranteeing settlement and the exchange determining terms except price. Features include centralized trading, price discovery, and margin requirements.</p>

    <p>Futures contract specifications set by the exchange include the underlying asset, contract multiplier/size (determines contract value when multiplied by price), contract cycle (period of trading), expiration day (last trading day for compulsory settlement or rollover), and tick size (minimum price movement). SEBI stipulates a minimum contract value of Rs. 15-20 lakhs for new index derivatives effective November 20, 2024.</p>

    <p>The basis is the difference between the spot price and the futures price, becoming zero at maturity. The cost of carry explains the relationship between futures and spot prices, representing costs (interest, storage) less benefits (income like dividends) of holding the asset. Participants are required to deposit margin (Initial Margin upfront, MTM margins daily) to cover potential losses, managed using systems like SPAN. Open interest is the total outstanding contracts (long equals short), indicating market depth.</p>

    <p>Payoff charts for futures are linear, showing unlimited profit and loss potential for both long and short positions. Futures pricing can be explained by the Cost of Carry model (fair price equals spot plus cost of carry minus inflows, assumes no arbitrage) and the Expectations model (futures price reflects expected spot price at maturity). Convenience yield is an intangible benefit of holding an asset (especially commodities) that can cause futures to trade at a discount.</p>

    <p>Futures are used for hedging (locking in future prices, such as long hedge for planned purchase, short hedge for planned sale, using index futures for portfolio systematic risk), trading/speculation (taking naked or spread positions based on price expectations, using leverage), and arbitrage (exploiting price differences, like cash-and-carry, reverse cash-and-carry, or calendar spreads).</p>

    <h2>Chapter 4: Introduction to Options</h2>
    <p>An option gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to trade an underlying asset at a specific price (strike price) by a certain date (expiry), with the buyer paying a premium and the seller having the obligation if the buyer exercises. Option types include call options (right to buy) and put options (right to sell). American options can be exercised anytime until expiry while European options only on expiry. In India, all index and stock options are European style.</p>

    <p>Key terms include strike price (the price at which the underlying can be traded if the option is exercised), premium (the price of the option), and underlying asset (stock or index). Options are classified by their moneyness: In-the-money (ITM) has positive intrinsic value if exercised immediately, with Call ITM when Spot is greater than Strike and Put ITM when Spot is less than Strike. At-the-money (ATM) means strike price is equal or closest to the spot price with zero intrinsic value. Out-of-the-money (OTM) means strike price is worse than spot for the holder with zero intrinsic value, where Call OTM has Spot less than Strike and Put OTM has Spot greater than Strike.</p>

    <p>Option premium consists of intrinsic value (the ITM amount, zero for ATM/OTM, never negative) and time value (premium minus intrinsic value). Time value is affected by time to expiry and volatility and decreases as expiry nears (time decay). Payoff charts for options show asymmetric risk: Long call/put (buyer) has limited loss (premium paid) and potentially unlimited profit, while Short call/put (seller) has limited profit (premium received) and potentially unlimited loss. Break-Even Point (BEP) for Long/Short Call is Strike plus Premium, and for Long/Short Put is Strike minus Premium.</p>

    <p>Options differ from futures in having asymmetric risk profiles (versus symmetric for futures) and the margin requirement structure (buyer pays premium, seller posts margin versus both parties posting margin for futures). Options offer significant leverage. Option prices are affected by the spot price, strike price, volatility, time to expiration, and interest rates, with higher volatility and longer time to expiration generally leading to higher premiums.</p>

    <p>Option Greeks measure the sensitivity of option price to these factors: Delta (sensitivity to underlying price, used as hedge ratio), Gamma (sensitivity of delta to underlying price), Theta (sensitivity to time decay), Vega (sensitivity to volatility), and Rho (sensitivity to interest rates). Option pricing models like the Binomial Model and the Black & Scholes Model are used to calculate theoretical option prices. Implied volatility is the expected volatility derived from the option's market price using a pricing model, differing from historical volatility, and traders use it to assess if options are cheap or expensive. Options are used for both trading (various strategies combining calls and puts) and hedging (buying options provides insurance against adverse price movements).</p>

    <h2>Chapter 5: Strategies using Equity Futures and Equity Options</h2>
    <p>Futures are used for hedging (locking in prices for future transactions, using hedge ratios based on portfolio beta for systematic risk), speculation (taking naked positions based on price forecasts, leveraging exposure), and arbitrage (exploiting mispricing, such as cash-and-carry, reverse cash-and-carry, calendar spreads). Arbitrage ensures price alignment but opportunities are brief.</p>

    <p>Option trading strategies include Spreads, Straddles, and Strangles. Vertical Spreads combine options with the same expiry but different strikes (Bullish/Bearish, using calls or puts), resulting in limited profit and limited loss. Horizontal (Calendar) Spread combines options with the same strike but different expiries as a bet on time value differences. Straddles combine a call and a put with the same strike and expiry, where Long straddle (buy call plus put) is for anticipating large price movement in either direction (unlimited profit, limited loss) and Short straddle (sell call plus put) is for anticipating stable price (limited profit, unlimited loss). Strangles combine an OTM call and an OTM put with different strikes but same expiry, where Long strangle (buy OTM call plus put) is similar to long straddle but cheaper and requires a larger price movement for profit, and Short strangle (sell OTM call plus put) is similar to short straddle, betting on stability, with limited profit and unlimited loss.</p>

    <p>Options can be used for hedging: buying a call hedges against price increases for a planned purchase, and buying a put hedges against price decreases for an existing position. A Protective Put (long stock plus long put) limits downside risk while retaining upside potential, with similar payoff to a long call. A Covered Call (long stock plus short call) generates income but limits upside potential, with similar payoff to a short put.</p>

    <p>Arbitrage using options is based on the Put-call parity principle, which relates the prices of calls and puts with the same strike and maturity on the same underlying (for European options). Deviations create arbitrage opportunities, although execution can be complex and risky. Delta-hedging is a strategy to manage the risk of an options portfolio by taking offsetting positions in the underlying asset based on the option's delta, aiming to maintain a delta-neutral position requiring dynamic adjustments.</p>

    <p>Traders interpret Open Interest and Put-Call Ratio (PCR) for trading strategies. Changes in futures price combined with changes in Open Interest can indicate trends (such as rising price plus rising OI suggesting bullish trend). PCR is generally a contrarian indicator (such as PCR less than 1 suggesting bearish trend).</p>

    <h2>Chapter 6: Trading Mechanism</h2>
    <p>Futures and options in India are traded on fully automated screen-based trading platforms at exchanges, using an order-driven market with transparency. Entities involved include Trading Members (TMs), Clearing Members (CMs), Trading cum Clearing Members (TCMs), Professional Clearing Members (PCMs), Self Clearing Members (SCMs), and Participants (clients), with TMs and APs required to comply with SEBI rules.</p>

    <p>Trading hours are typically 9:15 am to 3:30 pm, Monday to Friday, though SEBI permits extension up to 11:55 PM for exchanges with adequate risk management. Trading members have a corporate hierarchy (Corporate Manager, Branch Manager, Dealer) with varying levels of access and control. TMs are responsible for client compliance, including KYC, client agreements, margin collection, fund segregation, contract notes, and unique client codes (UCC).</p>

    <p>Order types include Day orders (valid for the day), Immediate or Cancel (IOC) orders (match instantly or cancel), Limit orders (execute at specified or better price), Market orders (execute at best available price), and Stop-loss orders (activated by a trigger price). Order matching follows price-time priority: best price first, then time priority. There are no price bands in the derivatives segment, but operating ranges (typically 10%) and contract-specific ranges for options prevent erroneous orders.</p>

    <p>Eligibility criteria for stocks for derivatives trading require them to be among the top 500 by market cap/traded value, meet minimum liquidity (MQSOS), and have a minimum Market Wide Position Limit (MWPL) and average daily delivery value. Stocks failing criteria for 3 consecutive months may lose eligibility for fresh contracts. Additional exit criteria based on a Product Success Framework (PSF) (trading activity, turnover, open interest) apply to stocks older than 6 months.</p>

    <p>Eligibility criteria for indices require constituent stocks eligible for derivatives to have a weightage of at least 80%, with no single ineligible stock exceeding 5% weightage. A PSF similar to stocks applies to most index derivatives. Adjustments for Corporate Actions (Bonus, Splits, Rights, Mergers, Dividends) are made to futures and options contracts to ensure the value of positions remains the same on cum and ex-dates, modifying strike prices, positions, or multipliers as needed. Extraordinary dividends (greater than 2% market value) trigger strike price adjustments.</p>

    <p>Trading costs include user charges (brokerage, exchange transaction fees) and statutory charges (STT, GST, Stamp Duty, SEBI turnover fees). Bid-ask spread and impact cost are implicit costs due to lack of liquidity. Algorithmic trading uses automated instructions for order execution, offering advantages like speed and emotion removal, but SEBI has cautioned against unregulated platforms promising high returns. Brokers offering algo services must follow specific guidelines.</p>

    <p>Market participants can track F&O data in real-time on exchange websites and trading platforms, including prices, volume, open interest, and derived indicators like Put/Call Ratio. The Investor Risk Reduction Access (IRRA) platform is a joint initiative providing an alternative for investors to square off positions or cancel pending orders during a trading member's site disruption. It is for individual investors only and does not allow initiating new positions. SEBI has also provided a framework for brokers to address technical glitches in their systems.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 7: Introduction to Clearing and Settlement System</h2>
    <p>The Clearing Corporation (CC) acts as the central counterparty (novation) and guarantees the financial settlement of all trades on the exchange's derivatives segment. Clearing and settlement involves Clearing (computing obligations), Settlement (actual funds/securities transfer), and Risk Management, done with Clearing Members (CMs) and Clearing Banks. CM types include Self-clearing, Trading member-cum-clearing member, and Professional clearing member, with CMs having eligibility criteria based on net worth and deposits.</p>

   <p>The Clearing Mechanism involves calculating the open positions of CMs by aggregating the proprietary and client positions of the TMs clearing through them. Interoperability of clearing corporations, implemented in 2019, allows brokers to choose a single CC for all their trades across exchanges, reducing costs, improving capital utilization, ensuring continuity during glitches, and simplifying operations.</p>

<p>Settlement of futures contracts involves daily mark-to-market (MTM) settlement (cash settled on T+1) and final settlement on the expiry day. Index futures are cash-settled while stock futures are settled by physical delivery (since Oct 2019). Final settlement price is based on the underlying's closing price. Settlement of options contracts involves daily premium settlement (buyer pays, seller receives premium, cash settled T+1) and final exercise settlement on the expiry day for ITM options. Index options are cash-settled while stock options are settled by physical delivery. Exercise settlement value for index options is the intrinsic value, and for stock options settled physically, it is the strike price multiplied by lot size.</p>

<p>A net settlement mechanism exists between cash and F&O segments on expiry for clients trading/clearing through the same TM-CM, allowing netting of physical delivery obligations and funds. Risk Management uses a comprehensive mechanism including stringent capital adequacy, upfront margins (Initial Margin, Premium Margin, Assignment Margin, Delivery Margins, Exposure Margins), daily MTM, and online position monitoring via SPAN (Standard Portfolio Analysis of Risk). The concept of Short Option Minimum Charge was removed.</p>

<p>Peak margin obligation rules (phased implementation since July 2020, with clarifications in 2022-2023) require brokers to collect margins based on Beginning of Day (BOD) margin parameters, verified through intraday snapshots, to curb excessive leverage. Cross margining is available across Cash and Derivatives segments for offsetting positions, reducing margin requirements. Early Pay-in (EPI) of securities or funds exempts positions from delivery margins.</p>

<p>A mandatory mechanism for pledge/repledge of client securities (since Sep 2020) via 'margin pledge' in the depository system prevents misuse of client collateral by brokers. Disaggregated client-level collateral reporting enhances visibility.</p>

<p>Position limits (client-level, trading member-wise, market-wide) are used to manage risk and prevent price manipulation by restricting open positions. Exceeding limits results in penalties and restrictions on taking fresh positions. Violations of rules/bye-laws/regulations can lead to penalties, withdrawal of membership rights, or close-out of positions. Mandatory settlement of running account of client funds by TMs on a monthly/quarterly basis prevents misuse.</p>

<p>The Core Settlement Guarantee Fund (Core SGF) guarantees trade settlement in case of member default. The Investor Protection Fund (IPF) compensates investors if a defaulting member's assets are insufficient. Recent SEBI measures effective Nov 2024 / Feb 2025 aim to strengthen the framework, including upfront collection of option premium, changes to calendar spread benefits/margins on expiry, intraday position limit monitoring, contract size revision, rationalizing weekly expiries, and additional tail risk margin. A Cyber Security & Cyber Resilience Framework (CSCRF) for market entities is being implemented (phased from Jan 1, 2025) to protect against cyber threats and ensure operational continuity.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8: Legal and Regulatory Environment</h2>
<p>Derivatives trading in India is governed by the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (SCRA) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (SEBI Act), along with associated rules and exchange bye-laws. SCRA defines "securities" to include derivatives and states that derivative contracts are legal and valid if traded on a recognized stock exchange and settled on its clearing house according to the rules.</p>

<p>The SEBI Act established SEBI with statutory powers to protect investors, promote market development, and regulate the securities market. Its powers cover regulating exchanges, registering intermediaries, prohibiting unfair practices, inspections, and enforcing delegated SCRA functions. SEBI approved the phased introduction of derivatives trading based on recommendations, requiring exchanges to meet eligibility criteria, have separate governing councils, and obtain SEBI approval for contracts.</p>

<p>Clearing and settlement must be through a SEBI-approved clearing corporation. Derivative brokers/dealers and clearing members require SEBI registration. Minimum net worth criteria apply to clearing members. Key regulations include minimum contract value (changing to Rs. 15-20 lakhs effective Nov 20, 2024), initial margin requirements, exposure limits, and margin demands.</p>

<p>Strict KYC norms and the use of a Risk Disclosure Document (RDD) are mandatory to ensure clients understand risks. Trading members must employ qualified, SEBI-certified approved users. Collateral deposits are segregated into cash and non-cash components. A default by a member in the derivatives segment is treated as a default across all segments and exchanges where they are members.</p>

<p>SEBI lays down Position Limits for clients, trading members, and the market-wide level to prevent price manipulation. Violations lead to penalties and restrictions. Eligibility criteria for exchange membership on the derivatives segment involve net worth requirements, liquid net worth, and certification requirements. SEBI has established a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for exchanges/CCs/depositories to handle warning signals of possible TM/CM default to protect clients. An SOP for handling stock exchange outages ensures communication and potential extension of trading hours during technical glitches.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9: Accounting and Taxation</h2>
<p>Accounting for Forward Contracts (per AS-11) differs based on whether they are for hedging (premium/discount amortized, exchange difference in P&L) or trading/speculation (no premium/discount recognized, gain/loss on valuation in P&L). Accounting for Equity Index and Stock Futures in client books involves recording initial margin (under Current Assets), daily MTM payments/receipts (in MTM account, can be index/stock wise), and handling open interests at the balance sheet date (provision for net loss, ignored net gain). P/L on final settlement or squaring-up is recognized in P&L, with initial margin released. Specific treatment for defaults and required disclosures are outlined.</p>

<p>Accounting for Equity Index Options (cash settled) involves recording initial margin (seller) and premium (buyer/seller). Daily margin payments/receipts for sellers are tracked. Open options at balance sheet date involve provisions for potential losses (buyer/seller) based on the difference between paid/received premium and prevailing premium. P/L on final settlement/exercise is recognized in P&L. Squaring-up involves transferring the premium difference to P/L. Weighted average method used for multiple options.</p>

<p>Accounting for Equity Stock Options (delivery settled) follows similar rules for inception, margin, and open options as cash settled options. However, final settlement involves accounting entries for the physical transfer of shares at the strike price. Required disclosures include accounting policies, details of collateral for initial margin, and details of outstanding option contracts.</p>

<p>Taxation of derivative transactions in securities shows that profits/losses are generally taxed under the head 'Profits and Gains from Business or Profession'. Since Finance Act, 2005, transactions on a recognized stock exchange are not considered speculative for tax purposes. Losses can be set off against any non-salary income and carried forward for 8 years against non-speculative business income if the return is filed by the due date. For Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs), gains/losses are taxed as Capital Gains (generally short-term). Income from F&O trading can also be taxed under the presumptive taxation scheme (Section 44AD) at 6% of turnover if turnover is below Rs 2 crores.</p>

<p>Securities Transaction Tax (STT) is levied on derivatives transactions on recognized exchanges. Rates vary based on whether it's an option sale, exercised option, or futures sale, and who pays it (seller or purchaser). For physical settlement of stock derivatives, the STT rate for delivery-based equity applies. The exchange calculates and collects STT based on traded price (futures) or premium (options).</p>

<h2>Chapter 10: Sales Practices and Investors Protection Services</h2>
<p>Financial institutions should adopt a customer-oriented approach, providing good advice and service. Investors should be cautious of promises of "High Return" or "Risk-Free" investments as returns are related to risk. Beware of unsuitable investment recommendations (such as risky products for low-risk individuals) and churning (excessive trading for commissions). Seek third-party advice after investor seminars.</p>

<p>Sales Agents must follow guidelines for contacting customers (reasonable times, identification, ending contact if requested) and maintain records. They must be courteous, professional, and avoid false assumptions or high-pressure tactics. Understanding the risk profile of the client is crucial for financial advisors to provide appropriate advice. Risk tolerance depends on factors like age, income, dependents, and investment horizon. There is a risk/return trade-off.</p>

<p>The Risk Disclosure Document (RDD) highlights risks in exchange trading, especially the heightened risks in equity derivatives due to leverage. Brokers must make clients understand these risks and obtain a signed RDD. Specific risks for futures clients (MTM calls, margin increases, illiquidity) and option clients (wasting asset for buyers, unlimited loss for sellers) are detailed. Higher volatility and potential system glitches pose additional risks.</p>

<p>SEBI mandates brokers to know their clients and ensure the suitability of derivative products sold, obtaining information on net worth, income, and experience. Recent regulations require brokers to display specific Risk Disclosure facts (based on a SEBI study showing high retail losses in F&O) on their websites, requiring client acknowledgment. Brokers must maintain individual client P/L data for 5 years, and exchanges/depositories display the facts.</p>

<p>Intermediaries must have written Anti Money Laundering (AML) procedures as per the Prevention of Money-Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA). This includes Customer Due Diligence (CDD) measures like obtaining client identity information (using reliable documents like PAN, Passport, Aadhaar), verifying beneficial ownership, and conducting ongoing scrutiny. The Policy for acceptance of clients should identify higher-risk clients and apply risk-sensitive CDD. Clients of Special Categories (CSC) like Non-residents, HNIs, Trusts, PEPs, etc., require higher diligence. The Client Identification Procedure (CIP) requires establishing identity using reliable sources and maintaining continuous familiarity. In-person Verification (IPV) is compulsory for account opening, though e-KYC and online methods are available.</p>

<p>A Unique Client Code (UCC) linked to the client's PAN is allotted after KYC for identification and strengthening norms. UCC is mapped with demat accounts to detect security diversion. Suspicious Transaction Reporting (STR) to the Financial Intelligence Unit – India (FIU-IND) is required under AML/CFT regulations for certain transactions. Examples include difficult identity verification, unclear source of funds, or large unexplained increases in activity. The client must not be informed of the suspicion.</p>

<p>The Investors Grievance Redressal Mechanism is a key regulatory function. Investors should first approach the concerned intermediary/exchange. The SEBI Complaints Redress System (SCORES) is a web-based centralized system for filing complaints online and tracking their resolution. The Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) Portal (SMARTODR) is a transformative digital platform established by MIIs to efficiently resolve disputes between investors and market participants through online conciliation and arbitration. It addresses various grievances including service-related issues, trade disputes, fee disputes, product misrepresentation, DP/Registrar issues, and compliance/ethical violations. The process involves filing, conciliation (aim for resolution within 21 days), and arbitration (if conciliation fails). MIIs monitor compliance with arbitration awards.</p>

<p>General Do's and Don'ts for investors emphasize dealing with registered intermediaries, doing due diligence, understanding risks, insisting on documentation, settling via banking channels, avoiding rumours/unrealistic promises, and following up on transactions/complaints.</p>
